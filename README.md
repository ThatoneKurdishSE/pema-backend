# README Pema
# About the application:

* Pema's mission:

    To make mindfulness practices like meditations + journaling accessible to different
    people across different communities.

    The goal is to have the application running in English, Arabic, and Kurdish.

    There will be guided meditations in the three languages + in future versions journaling tools + prompts.

    This was initially my capstone project, however I am deeply passionate about this application + would like to keep working at it.
