Pema's mission:

To make mindfulness practices like meditations + journaling accessible to different
people across different communities.

The goal is to have the application running in English, Arabic, and Kurdish.

There will be guided meditations in the three languages + in future versions journaling tools + prompts.

The backend is built using Ruby on Rails and the frontend is built using React Native.

This was initially my capstone project, however I am deeply passionate about this application + would like to keep working at it.
